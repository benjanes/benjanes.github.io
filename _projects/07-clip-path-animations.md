title: "Clip Path Animations"
desc: Clip path is a trusty attribute in SVG, but the elements that define a clip path aren't animatable in all browsers because they are nested within <def> tags. The clip path CSS property is now available in some browsers and can be used to create some fun CSS effects. These currently only work in webkit browsers.
