desc: I made a physical harmonograph for a hack day project with some work friends a while back and was taken by how mesmerizing it was to watch it in action. Wanted to make a virtual version of one where I could cheaply try out different ideas while still getting to get lost in the motion... watching the process unfold is often a lot better than the end result with these designs.
