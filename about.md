I am a full stack software developer based in the greater NYC area. I love to tackle complex, challenging problems in a collaborative, dynamic team environment. I have an aptitude for building effective, engaging user interfaces. In recent projects I have focused on data exchange amongst clients using web sockets, custom data visualization in React using SVG, and building APIs in Node/Express. I always aim to write clear, functional code that is easily understood and can be revisited in the future by other developers.

In a previous life, I worked as a botanist and plant ecologist. When I'm not programming, I mostly either go rock climbing or spend time thinking about going rock climbing. I also enjoy hiking and backpacking with my wife and dog.
