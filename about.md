# hi

I'm a UI-focused software developer based in Beacon, NY. Currently writing Clojure and Clojurescript for [Amperity](https://amperity.com/). I'm very into vector graphics (SVG and canvas), interactive UI and animations, and straightforward, consistent UI/UX that keeps users happy. In my free time I can be found working on generative design concepts, hiking and running around the Hudson Valley, rock climbing, and brainstorming how to make sure that my toddler is interested in hiking and climbing.
