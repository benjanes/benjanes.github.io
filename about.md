# hi

I'm a UI/UX-focused software developer based in Beacon, NY. Currently working on [Clay](https://clay.earth/), previously at [Amperity](https://amperity.com/)/[Custora](https://amperity.com/blog/a-new-day-amperity-acquires-custora)/[McCann](https://www.mccannny.com/).

I'm very into vector graphics (SVG and canvas), interactive UI and animations, and UI/UX more generally. In my free time I can be found working on generative design concepts, hiking and running around the Hudson Valley, rock climbing, and wrangling two little kids.
